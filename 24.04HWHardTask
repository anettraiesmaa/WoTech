//Hard:
//1. Create a program, where user can provide a title and a small text below the title.
//Title should be wrapped with ====== at top and bottom, based on the title length.
//Example: 
//System asks for title and user provides "WoTech and Java is easy"
//System asks for description and user provides "I have been learning Java for 6 weeks now."

//Result: 
//=======================
//WoTech and Java is easy
//=======================

//I have been learning Java for 6 weeks now.
